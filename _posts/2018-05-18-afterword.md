Another chapter ends <br>
and the hero stumbles offstage<br>
bruised and longing for a better story<br>
though he won’t admit it.

With a rueful smile, he jokes that<br>
love always wakes the dragon but<br>
now the princess thinks<br>
he’s the one breathing fire.

_Dear So-and-So,_<br>
remember when you said I could be anything<br>
so between hope and despair<br>
I chose to be a hero.

And remember when you said I could do anything<br>
so I loved absolutely, only to find<br>
the window to her heart painted shut.

_Dear So-and-So,_<br>
won’t you write us a happy ending?<br>
and then we won’t be so sad when it’s over.

Walk through our dreams<br>
give us something more than incomplete desires<br>
until then I'll leave our story in your hands.

So won’t you tell me<br>
we’re not doomed in the grand scheme of things<br>
that we’re not just tiny specks to be forgotten.

Let the camera pan to where the action is,<br>
all I ask is that you won't leave us behind.

So forget the dragon<br>
just take my hand, let’s jump ahead to<br>
when we’re no longer alone.

I’m just a writer but<br>
put all we can't say out loud on paper<br>
and we’ll forever be the heroes.

> It took me a while, but I found the piece that was the motivation for this one - "Litany in Which Certain Things Are Crossed Out" by Richard Siken. I think it was around the time we had to submit graduation quotes, and I wanted to cram in a small poem of my own making. In the end I gave up and went with a BoJack Horseman bit instead, but only after I spewed this out. It's pretty long and it doesn't really make sense - but sure, I'm still fond of it.
