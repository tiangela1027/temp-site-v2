alone he dances, arms poised<br> 
to embrace his demons, all of them<br>
slaves to the lonely, lonely waltz

deaf to familiar lyrics, familiar<br> 
only to an isolated pulse, they succumb<br>
five feet under with hardly a sound

sadness soaked into the carpet,<br>
regret blasting from a sole speaker,<br>
shadows swaying slowly to the despair

in slow circles, pale limbs posed, in silence<br>

<br>

chin raised, closed eyes,<br>
still heart

they captured him, alive<br> 
in the viewfinder, with bated breath,<br> 
in a monochrome world

a fixture to the window, behind his lonely throne,<br>
unmoved by worship, pleas,<br>
or sorrow 

time flows, streaming, like<br> 
rays seeped in from drawn curtains,<br>
poured into the cracks of stone-cold skin

like blood rivers of fallen statues, hollowed,<br>
forgotten do the drops of light cascade<br>
down his face

it is as the sun fails to rise,<br>
and he falls, soundless, that he wonders <br>
if this is the right side of heaven

yet feet dragging along in the uncertain<br> 
silence, still they dance to the soul<br> 
ballad that never ends

> Grim Fandango, by LucasArts (I played the remastered version by Double Fine), was my primary motivation.<br>
>
> "With bony hands I hold my partner,<br>
> on soulless feet we cross the floor,<br>
> the music stops as if to answer,<br>
> an empty knocking at the door.<br>
> It seems his skin was sweet as mango,<br>
> when last I held him to my breast,<br>
> but now, we dance this grim fandango,<br>
> and will four years until we rest."

> I played it to 80% completion four years ago, and finally 100% last month. But it's amazing, truly.<br> 
> Don't be like me. Do yourself a favour - play it, finish it, adore it.
