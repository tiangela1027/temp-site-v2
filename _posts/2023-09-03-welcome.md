I'm a software engineer with a passion for cloud-based development based in Vancouver, BC. My main areas of focus are DevOps and Cloud, where I have worked in the field of DevOps for 2+ years.

I graduated as a Computer Science major from the UBC Bachelor of Science program. I passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate (SAA) exam in August 2023, and I am currently studying for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam.

My favourite tools currently are Terraform and GitHub Actions. I like working with Linux and writing scripts in Python or Golang, as well as solving and optimizing interesting infrastructure problems. Continually learning about and becoming more proficient in new and existing technologies is a massive passion of mine.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, where I'll read anything from auto-biographies to mystery novels, and watching whatever's currently playing in the cinema, from blockbusters to indie films. I also like to spend my evenings playing music, where I have played the piano since I was six years old and I picked up the violin since September 2022.

One of my hobbies is to write, where I have posted here a few of the pieces of which I am most proud. These can be found under the [Writing](/categories/writing/) category, where I will try to post more from time to time.
